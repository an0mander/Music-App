[Hook:]
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I want to do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind

I want to touch you but I'm too late
I want to touch you but there's history
I can't believe that it's been three years
Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet

[Hook]

You want to touch me but you're too late
You want to touch me but there's too much history
Starting to live the lies we tell ourselves
I only need you to be friends with me

[Hook]

I've never felt so close
But now I know it's over
And all I want to do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
(Between us)
There's a love between us still but something's changed and I don't know why
(I've never felt so close, but now I know it's over)
And all I want to do is go home with you but I know I'm out of my mind
(Between us)
(Never felt, never felt, never, never felt)
